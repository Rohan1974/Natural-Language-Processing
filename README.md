This code appears to be a simple spam categorization project that employs two distinct approaches: Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.

The project includes:
importing the necessary libraries--> preprocessing a spam dataset--> dividing it into training and testing sets--> using Multinomial Naive Bayes classification--> 
evaluating accuracy--> saving and loading the model--> and allowing users to input and predict whether an email is spam or not.

The Bag-of-Words (BoW) Approach:

The function converts text input to numerical vectors using scikit-learn's CountVectorizer. Multinomial Naive Bayes is used for classification.
Accuracy is calculated, and the model is kept for further use. The user may enter an email sentence, and the algorithm will determine if it is spam or not.

TF-IDF Approach:

The code extracts features using the TfidfVectorizer. Classification is performed using Multinomial Naive Bayes, which is similar to the Bag-of-Words technique. The accuracy is determined, and the model is stored.
The user may enter an email sentence, and the algorithm will determine if it is spam or not.
